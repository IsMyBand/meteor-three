# Three.js - A JavaScript 3D library, repackaged for Meteor.

[Three.js](http://threejs.org)
[Meteor](http://meteor.com)
<!-- [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/) -->

## How to install 
`meteor add limemakers:three`

I'll try to keep this package up to date with each Three.js release. If you use this package and want me to add in any of the other loaders from the examples folder, send me a message and I'll update this package to include it.
